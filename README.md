## Updated Portfolio Site
An updated one-page portfolio site, using Materialize, jQuery, and Firebase.

# How it works
This site uses jQuery to scroll to different sections via id. A back-to-top button(initially hidden) was added to allow users to scroll back to the top. A Materialize carousel displays featured projects. Future updates will most likely be portfolio additions and updates to th cv section.

The site uses Materialize components for mobile responsive navigation, the carousel, the contact form, and for the grid layouts. Firebase stores messages sent through the contact form; I'm exploring other options for having form submissions sent to my email address.

# Built with
* [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) - CSS framework
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - DOM manipulation and events
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - database logic
