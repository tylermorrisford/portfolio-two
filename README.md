## Updated Portfolio Site
An updated one-page portfolio site, using Materialize, jQuery, and Firebase.

# How it works
This site uses jQuery to scroll to different sections via id. In future updates I'll add a scrollspy element and hide the main navigation so that users can navigate up and down, and may decide to make each section fullscreen height. 

This site uses Materialize components for mobile responsive navigation and the contact form, and for the grid layouts. Firebase stores messages sent through the contact form; I'm exploring other options for having form submissions sent to my email address.

# Built with
* [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) - CSS framework
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - DOM manipulation and events
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - database logic
